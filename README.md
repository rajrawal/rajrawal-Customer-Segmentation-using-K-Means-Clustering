## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a key strategy in marketing that allows businesses to categorize their customer base into distinct groups. This project uses K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer transaction data, including features such as purchase frequency and average purchase value. The dataset can be found [here](#) (link to the dataset if available).

## Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Feature selection (e.g., purchase frequency, average purchase value)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them. Visualizations included histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

## K-Means Clustering

Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers:

- Standardized the features
- Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Implemented K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters

## Cluster Analysis

Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to interpret their significance. Identified key traits and behaviors of each customer segment.

## Data Visualization

Created interactive visualizations using Tableau to present the clustering results. Visualizations included:

- Scatter plots of clusters
- Bar charts and pie charts for cluster composition
- Dashboards summarizing insights

## Results

The clustering analysis revealed distinct customer segments, each with unique purchasing behaviors. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies to target specific customer groups more effectively.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Tableau

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering provides valuable insights that can enhance marketing strategies. By understanding different customer segments, businesses can create targeted campaigns that improve customer engagement and increase sales.
